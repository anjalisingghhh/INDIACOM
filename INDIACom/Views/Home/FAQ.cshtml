    <!-- FAQ 15 -->
    <a class="faq" onclick="toggleList('15')">My paper has already been accepted and registration charges have been paid, but the paper was not presented. Under these circumstances, what will be the provision of IEEE organization? Will my paper be published in the conference proceedings?</a>
    <div id="15" class="faq-content">
        Since the paper has not been presented, it will NOT be forwarded to IEEE Xplore. Also, registration fee, once paid is not refundable. At best, only a locally published copy can be sent to the author(s) at the postal address intimated to the Conference Organizers.
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 16 -->
    <a class="faq" onclick="toggleList('16')">There have been cases when IEEE published accepted papers for which registration charges had been paid, even if the paper was not presented due to unavoidable circumstances. Why is the practice not being followed now?</a>
    <div id="16" class="faq-content">
        The practice might have been adopted earlier, but now it is totally against the policy of IEEE. Hence, as geographic representative of IEEE, itâ€™s Delhi Section, under whose jurisdiction the conference was held, doesn't follow and subscribe to the practices and views as expressed by the author(s), unfortunately those being bad practices as quoted.
    </div>

    <!-- FAQ 17 -->
    <a class="faq" onclick="toggleList('17')">It is our humble request to kindly publish our paper (that was not presented) in IEEE conference proceedings.</a>
    <div id="17" class="faq-content">
        Sorry, but as made clear above, the accepted paper(s) which are NOT presented in the conference would not be sent for publication in the IEEE Xplore. However, to summarize, upon intimation to Conference Organizers (not to IEEE Delhi Section, but to the Conference Secretariat), local publications could be sent in the name of registered author. For future it is advised that if the registered author cannot come to the conference for presenting paper, any of the other co-author(s) may come and present the paper. In such case the paper automatically becomes eligible for publication through IEEE Xplore.
        <br><font color="#FF0000">But since in this case paper was not presented, upon request to Conference Organizers, so IEEE Copyright Form pledged in favor of IEEE could be cancelled enabling the paper to be shown withdrawn thus to be eligible for submission elsewhere for further consideration (avoiding automatically duplicate submission with record changed accordingly).
